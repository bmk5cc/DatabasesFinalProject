# DatabasesFinalProject
Note: Project doesn't represent best coding practices due to time constraints

## Set up
Once the project is cloned, create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) within the root folder of the project.
Then run pip install -r requirements.txt

Also add DB_SOCIAL_KEY and DB_SOCIAL_SECRET. You can either ask for mine, or make you own through [google](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/library?supportedpurview=project). Then enable the google+ api

If you want to log in to view the add and delete course functionality, modify students/fixtures/db1.json to have your computing id in one of the students.
