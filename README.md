# DatabasesFinalProject
Note: Project doesn't represent best coding practices due to time constraints

## Set up
Once the project is cloned, create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) within the root folder of the project.
Then run pip install -r requirements.txt

Also add SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY and SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET. You can either ask for mine, or make you own through [google](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/library?supportedpurview=project)
